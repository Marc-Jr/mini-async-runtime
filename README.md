# mini-async-runtime
A minimal single-threaded async runtime in Rust.

## About
This project is an educational implementation of a lightweight asynchronous runtime in Rust .It demonstrates the fundamentals of task scheduling and execution within a single thread, providing a hands-on understanding of how asynchronous runtimes operate under the hood

## Features

- **Single-threaded Execution** Designed to run on a single thread, making it ideal for embedded systems or learning environment.
- **Task Scheduling** Manages and schedules asynchronous tasks efficientl.
- **Minimal Dependencies** Built with a focus on simplicity and minimalism, avoiding unnecessary dependencie.

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marc-Jr/mini-async-runtime.git
cd mini-async-runtime
cargo build
``


Run the exampe:


```bash
cargo run
``


## 🧪 Example Output


```text
Runtime started...
task one: start
task two: start
task one: done [~1s]
task two: done [~2s]
``

